# UNIXShell

Cuurently Working on implementing a UNIX shell. 
1. This shell will be able to print the output of any program to a file. It will be able to direct any error messages on to the file as well if chosen. 
2. This shell will be able to pass as in as an input another programs output/error message. You can daisy chain 3 of these input -> output together
3. This shell will also be able to list all files in a directory as well as their sizes with a command.
